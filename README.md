unity video game featuring Euclidian portals, a grappling hook, and procedural generation of levels

All level Names need to be in the format "Level_0*" where star is the level number. This is due to some of the dynamic setup that has been implemented. 
This also applies to the level entrances and they must be in the format "Level_**_Entrance". Do not forget that when spawned, the level entrances will actually be named
"Level_**_Entrance(Clone)" This is important for coding the dynamic variable allocation that you will need.
